    <h1>Front-End challenge: Progress Indicator</h1>
<p>My solution to the <a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/challenge-009-progress-indicator/">progress indicator challenge</a>, as part of the <a href="https://piccalil.li/category/front-end-challenges-club/">Front-End Challenges Club on Piccalilli</a>.</p>
<!-- NOTES:
     - styling <progress> is possible, but takes a lot of extra work with annoying prefixed stuff
       so will be using role="progressbar" and other aria features. I *think* this is okay ðŸ˜….
     - Those attributes are all added via JS, this has the added benefit that it's only a
       progress bar if JS is enabled.
     - I think this makes the most sense, since we can't really track progress of an action 
       if there is no JS.
     - Maybe it's better to have a progress with an indeterminate value though? But I'm making the
       assumption that it's the progress of an action a user is taking, in which case, it doesn't
       make sense to have a progressbar if there's no JS, since we can't keep track then. 
     - Further, maybe it's best to simply `display: none` the entire thing in that case, but that
       would be very much context dependent.
